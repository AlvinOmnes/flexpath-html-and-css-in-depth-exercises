Exercise 23: Understanding CSS Specificity
Description: Explain why an element with an inline style style="color: red;" will have red text even if an external CSS file sets the color to blue for that element.
Answer:

Inline styles have higher specificity than external stylesheets because they are applied directly to the element. The specificity hierarchy is:

Inline styles (style attribute) â€“ Highest specificity.
IDs (#id selectors).
Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes (.class, [type="text"], :hover).
Elements and pseudo-elements (h1, ::after).
Therefore, the inline color: red; overrides the external CSS color: blue;.
